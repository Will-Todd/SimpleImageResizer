# SimpleImageResizer

Very basic console app that uses [James South's ImageProcessor](https://imageprocessor.org/) to recursively increase the dimensions of all PNGs in a given folder to nearest multiple of four.

Made for batch converting horrible drawings at [coalsupper.com](https://coalsupper.com)
